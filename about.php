    <h2 class="about_title">How to Join</h2>
    <p class="para">Anybody can join the mens’ ultimate program at Cornell! Our developmental B team, "the Shake," does not have tryouts, and anybody can play with them! The Buds have a competitive tryout process that lasts several weeks at the beginning of the fall season. Please email the captains at buds@cornell.edu if you have any questions about the tryout process.
    </p>
    <p class="para">The Shake are one of the strongest B teams in the country, routinely qualifying for D1 Regionals, which the Buds also attend. The purpose of the Shake is to develop young players by giving them opportunities to grow and improve, and create a pipeline of players who can move up to the Buds.

    <h2 class="about_title">General Schedule</h2>
    <p class="para">We practice 3-4 times a week during the Fall season, and 2-3 practices and 2-3 workouts a week during the Spring season. We also travel to tournaments all around the country, but in the fall we typically stay within the Northeast. In the fall we usually go to 3-4 tournaments, and in the spring we typically go to 4-6. In the past, we have gone to tournaments in California, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and many other states!

    <h2 class="about_title">History of Cornell Buds</h2>
    <p class="para">Cornell Buds is Cornell University’s elite ultimate program, and one of the oldest college ultimate teams in the country, playing teams each year since the program was founded in 1973. The team sets a high standard of excellence: Cornell Buds have placed 1st in sectionals in 12 of the past 17 seasons, and 1st in regionals in eight of the past 17 seasons, which also took them to nationals eight times.
    </p>
    <p id="para2">We look to combine our love of ultimate with an intense, competitive, athletic practice and tournament regiment. Through this collective experience, the Buds not only find success on the field but also build lasting relationships that extend beyond our time at Cornell.
