# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.
White-Eagle
Mr799 - Michael Russo
Rb725 - Rishab Bhandari
jq77-Junan Qu
dwj37 - Daniel Jones
Sgl55 - Socrates Leotsakos

2. To what goals do we all commit?

Making a great website that meets our clients’ needs while having fun and learning how to work in teams and web development skills. Working efficiently and collaboratively to meet deadlines on time.

3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)
Don’t miss deadlines. If you are having problems, reach out asap. Don’t wait until time is running out to let the rest of the team know that you need help. Be respectful of the other members of the team.

4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
We will create a groupme to communicate with each other and set of meeting times and communicate for our project. We plan to meet as many times as needed, but could be around 3 times per week.

5. How will we communicate and work with our client?
Email, face to face meeting, and Groupme


6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
Michael: Interactivity expert / PHP7.1.7
Socrates: Design Senior Advisor / CSS3
Rishab: Team Management / HTML5
Daniel: Content editing and / SQL
Junan Qu: Risk Management / CSS3 SQL, dropdown menu

7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
Communication is key to successful group work. It is expected that people deliver on what they have been assigned or volunteer to do, however it is understandable that we can run into problems or issues with delivery. The best thing we can do is to make sure to communicate with the rest of the group when something goes wrong or when help is needed. We help each other out and try to understand the situation.


8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

We should discuss thoroughly to try to figure out what the best way forward is. If this fails to create a consensus, we should cast a vote, since we have an odd number majority rules will reign.

9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

If a majority of us feel something is wrong, we can update the contract.

10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

Try to be positive and enjoy the work! We’ll end up with a more fun site for our client that way.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is to follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
